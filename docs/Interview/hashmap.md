## Terms

- **Collision**: when two keys' hash values are the same, they are going to map to the two same location in the array.
- **Load Factor**:  assume your hash table has size m, which means that there is room for up to m items in it. But we also care about how many elements we are actually storing in the array right now â€” we denote this number by s. The ratio $alpha = \frac{s}{m}$ is called the _load factor_ of the hash table. When it is small, there is a lot of room in the table. If it ever exceeds 1, we are guaranteed that a collision must have occurre.


Typically, load factor maintains the ratio of number of `<key, value>` pairs / number of buckets. Usually it's under 1/2.

> This array has a loading factor of 7/13.

- **Hashing Function**: So how many random keys do we need to draw until we expect to see our first collision? There are m possible indices of h(k) we can draw, and if any two draws have the same index, then we have a collision. This is exactly an instance of the Birthday Paradox, so we would expect our first collision to occur around key number $\theta(\sqrt{m})$. In other words, even if we think that the keys are drawn randomly (which should be pretty friendly to the hash table), the first collisions should occur around load factor $\alpha = \theta(\sqrt{m})$. This is all the more reason why we will need to deal with collisions below.

- Modulo Arithmetic: $h(k) = k$ mod $m$ the problem is that it might get very clustered key items in particular digits (e.g. m = 10 then all the if all numbers has the same last two digits will fall into the same key). Solution: choose a large prime number.

- **Chaining**: using a linkedlist to store all the collide values, do a linear scan to check if exist in the linkedlist.

Time Complexity: assume the size of each linkedlist is $l_i$, and we have $s$ elements in total, then the possibability for a given element to fall on $l_i$ is $l_i / s$, it will take $\theta(l_i)$ to find in the linkedlist. Thus the total time complexity is $\theta (\frac{1}{s} \times \sum_i l_i^{2})$

- **Probing or Open Addressing**: use only one list to store all the values, and find the next avaliable location for inserting if there is a collision.

1. Linear Probing: if position i is occupied, then try i + 1, i + 2... until find the first free place. In practice it's a bad idea: assume you have filled 0, ..., m / 2 positions in the list. The possibability of filling next element that will fall in 0, ..., m / 2 is 1/2, which will take m/2 + 1 operations to find the next avaliable place.
