# Path Sum

Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,

```
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \      \
7    2      1
```

return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path `5->4->11->2` which sum is 22.

## Analysis

The path has be from root to leaf, and we need to make sure our code satisfy both:

1. if `node->left==nullptr && node->right==nullptr`, then the node is a leaf node
2. if `current sum==sum`, then current path sum is satisfied.

We can then use recursion to solve.



* TIme: $O(n)$ where n is number of nodes in the tree
* Space: $O(n)$ worst case when tree is a linkedlist

## Code

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
        if (!root) return false;// already visited to the children node of leaf
        sum -= root -> val;
      	// is leaf node + curr sum == target sum
        if (!sum && !root -> left && !root -> right) return true;
        return hasPathSum(root -> left, sum) || hasPathSum(root -> right, sum);
    }
};  
```
