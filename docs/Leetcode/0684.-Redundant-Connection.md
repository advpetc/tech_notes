# 0684. Redundant Connection

In this problem, a tree is an **undirected** graph that is connected and has no cycles.

The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of `edges`. Each element of `edges` is a pair `[u, v]` with `u < v`, that represents an **undirected** edge connecting nodes `u` and `v`.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge `[u, v]` should be in the same format, with `u < v`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
  1
 / \
2 - 3
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
5 - 1 - 2
    |   |
    4 - 3
```



**Note:**

The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.

Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.





**Update (2017-09-26):**
We have overhauled the problem description + test cases and specified clearly the graph is an ***undirected\*** graph. For the ***directed\*** graph follow up please see **[Redundant Connection II](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection-ii/description/)**). We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

## Analysis

To fast determine if there is a cycle given edges, we can check if any two given two nodes already sharing the same parent, with Union-Find with path compression, we can "almost" get in done with O(1).

-- as you can see to determine if one node belong to any root we can run it with O(1)

## Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> p; 
    int find(int x) {
        if (x != p[x]) p[x] = find(p[x]);
        return p[x];
    }
    vector<int> findRedundantConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        p = vector<int>(edges.size() + 1);
        for (int i = 1; i <= edges.size(); ++i) p[i] = i;
        for (auto e : edges) {
            int u = e[0], v = e[1];
            int r1 = find(u), r2 = find(v);
            if (r1 == r2) return e;
            else p[r1] = r2;
        }
        return {0, 0};
    }
};
```
