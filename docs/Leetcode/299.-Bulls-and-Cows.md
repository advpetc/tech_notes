# Bulls and Cows

You are playing the **[Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)** game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

- The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
- The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return *the hint for your friend's guess*.

The hint should be formatted as `"xAyB"`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
Output: "1A3B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1807"
  |
"7810"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
Output: "1A1B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1123"        "1123"
  |      or     |
"0111"        "0111"
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: secret = "1", guess = "0"
Output: "0A0B"
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: secret = "1", guess = "1"
Output: "1A0B"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000`
- `secret.length == guess.length`
- `secret` and `guess` consist of digits only.

## Analysis

We need to calculate the number of "bulls" and "cows" given two strings. To calculate "bulls" is simple: just check each index of the two strings, and if the elements they are point to each are equal, we increment our "bulls" count.

Calculating "cows" is a little harder. If a character from guess appeared in secret (no matter before current index or after), we increment our "cows" count. Besides, if a `guess[i]` already matched with a `secret[j]`, we cannot reuse `secret[j]` again. In order to solve this problem, we can use a map to record how many avalible `secret[j]` we can use, if there are `secret[k] == secret[j]` and `k != j`.

After we built this map, we can run a check on each character from guess string, and keep updating the value of the map until it reaches 0.

* Time: $O(n)$
* Space: $O(n)$ when all characters in secret string are distinct.

## Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string getHint(string secret, string guess) {
        int cows = 0, bulls = 0;
        int n = secret.size();
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (secret[i] == guess[i])
                bulls ++;
            else 
                mp[secret[i]]++;            
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (secret[i] != guess[i] && mp[guess[i]]-- > 0) 
                cows ++;
        }
        return to_string(bulls) + "A" + to_string(cows) + "B";
    }
};
```
