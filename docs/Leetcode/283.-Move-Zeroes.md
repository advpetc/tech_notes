# Move Zeroes

Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Note** that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`

 

**Follow up:** Could you minimize the total number of operations done?

## Analysis

All the questions regarding displacing from one to the other can be solved by using two pointers. For this question, we need to track the current **zero** position (`j`) and current **processing** position (`i`). We don't need to care about the sequence of zeros, but we need to take care of the sequence of non-zeros. Thus, we should loop from the **processing** position from begining to the end. If we see any zero while processing, we should move the next element that is non-zero (`i`) to the current zero position (`j`). We should also increase `j` by 1 since the next zero position to mark current `j` has been swapped with non-zero. Now, the new `j` can either be zero or non-zero, but what can be sure is that for next swap the current `j` will be non-zero and the sequence is always correct.

* Time: $O(n)$
* Space: $O(1)$

## Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i]) { // j will only record the non-zero position
                swap(nums[j++], nums[i]);
            }
        }
    
    }
};
```
