# Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:

Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

```
      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

## Analysis

To build a bst from a sorted **array**, we can do so by recursively finding the middle of the array to generate the tree. However, we need extra time to find the middle of a linkedlist (use fast slow pointer requires $O(n)$)

We can definitely use fast slow pointer to find the mid in each iteration and the psuedo code would like

sort(node):
  set mid = find_min_for_head
  set root->value = mid->value
