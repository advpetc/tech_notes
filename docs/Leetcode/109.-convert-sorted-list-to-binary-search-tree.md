# 0109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

Given the `head` of a singly linked list where elements are **sorted in ascending order**, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of *every* node never differ by more than 1.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](resources/109.jpg)

```
Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: head = [1,3]
Output: [3,1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in `head` is in the range `[0, 2 * 104]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

## Analysis

To build a bst from a sorted **array**, we can do so by recursively finding the middle of the array to generate the tree. However, we need extra time to find the middle of a LinkedList (use a fast-slow pointer requires $O(n)$)

We can definitely use fast-slow pointer to find the mid in each iteration and the pseudo code would like

```
  sort(node):
 		set mid = find_min_for_head
  	set root->value = mid->value
  	set root -> left = sort(node)
  	set root -> right = sort(node)
```

Using this way, we can generate the balanced search tree.

* Time: $O(n)$
* Space: $O(n)$ for call stack

## Code

```c++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* dfs(ListNode* head, ListNode* tail) {
        if (head == tail) return nullptr;
        ListNode* mid = head, *curr = head;
        while (curr != tail && curr -> next != tail) {
            mid = mid -> next;
            curr = curr -> next -> next;
        }
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(mid -> val);
        root -> left = dfs(head, mid);
        root -> right = dfs(mid -> next, tail);
        return root;
    }
    
    TreeNode* sortedListToBST(ListNode* head) {
        return dfs(head, nullptr);
    }
};
```
