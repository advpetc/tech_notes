# Container with Most Water

Given `n` non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an` , where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, ai)`. `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line `i`is at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 104`

## Using two pointers

```c
if a_i > a_j:
  then j --
else
  then i ++
until two pointers have met 
```

**Proof**:
Assume the answer is $i^{'}$ and $j^{'}$ where $(i^{'} < j^{'})$, use $S^{'}$ to represent the total water. Also assume $a_i > a_j$, so i to j - 1 should have the answer. We need to prove it is correct by showing optimal isn't in i + 1 to j
Assume there is another $S$ that is greater than $S^{'}$, then
S = $\min(a_i, a_j) \times (j - i)$ and $j > j^{'}$
$= a_i \times (j - i)$
$> a_i \times (j^{'} - i)$
$\geqslant \min(a_i, a_{j^{'}}) \times (j^{'} - i) = S^{'}$

## Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0, j = height.size() - 1; i < j; )
        {
            res = max(res, 
                  min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i));
            if (height[i] > height[j]) j -- ;
            else i ++ ;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
