# 815. Bus Routes

You are given an array `routes` representing bus routes where `routes[i]` is a bus route that the `ith` bus repeats forever.

- For example, if `routes[0] = [1, 5, 7]`, this means that the `0th` bus travels in the sequence `1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> ...` forever.

You will start at the bus stop `source` (You are not on any bus initially), and you want to go to the bus stop `target`. You can travel between bus stops by buses only.

Return *the least number of buses you must take to travel from* `source` *to* `target`. Return `-1` if it is not possible.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: routes = [[1,2,7],[3,6,7]], source = 1, target = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the second bus to the bus stop 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: routes = [[7,12],[4,5,15],[6],[15,19],[9,12,13]], source = 15, target = 12
Output: -1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= routes.length <= 500`.
- `1 <= routes[i].length <= 105`
- All the values of `routes[i]` are **unique**.
- `sum(routes[i].length) <= 105`
- `0 <= routes[i][j] < 106`
- `0 <= source, target < 106`

## Analysis

### Method 1: BFS with sort, using each route as a node

Seeing each route as a node, the edge can only be formed when two routes share one or more stops. Create a `map<index, set<index>>` indicates the index from `routes` can be used as the node. To construct this map, we will need to do a $O(n^2 \times m)$ loop to iterate and find which two routes have intersections, `m` is the average stop size of each route and `n` is the number of routes. To efficiently find the intersections, we can do a two-pointer trick, but we first need to sort each stop in each route. Then we will run a multi-source BFS to find the shortest path, which will take $O(n)$ . 

### Method 2: BFS using each stop as a node

Since we only care about which two stops are our source and target, and we want to know finding their related route, an easier way to construct our graph is simply by using the stop as a node. The map now looks like `map<stop, vector<index>>`, and it will only take $O(n \times m)$ where `n` is route size and `m` is the average size of each route's stops. Now if we run the multi-source BFS again, we might iterate through the same route multiple times, but the total times are bounded by the total number of stops, so it will be $O(n \times m)$.

    map<int, set<int>> graph; // index -> index
    int n = routes.size();
    set<int> s, e; // could be multiple source/target

    // build graph & find start and end node
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      set<int> a(routes[i].begin(), routes[i].end());
      if (a.count(source))

            break;
          } else if (routes[i][a] < routes[j][b]) {

          } else {
            b++;
          }
        }
      }
    }

    if (s.empty() || e.empty())
      return -1;
    // bfs
    queue<pair<int, int>> q;
    for (int start : s) {
      q.push(make_pair(start, 1));
    }
    set<int> visited(s.begin(), s.end());
    int res = INT_MAX;
    while (!q.empty()) {
      auto p = q.front();
      q.pop();
      int t = p.first, level = p.second;

      if (e.count(t)) {
        res = min(res, level);
      }

      for (int neighbour : graph[t]) {
        if (!visited.count(neighbour)) {
          q.push(make_pair(neighbour, level + 1));
          visited.insert(neighbour);
        }
      }
    }
    return res == INT_MAX ? -1 : res;
