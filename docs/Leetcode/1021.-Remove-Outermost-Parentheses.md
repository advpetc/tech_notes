# Remove Outermost Parentheses

A valid parentheses string is either empty `("")`, `"(" + A + ")"`, or `A + B`, where `A` and `B` are valid parentheses strings, and `+` represents string concatenation. For example, `""`, `"()"`, `"(())()"`, and `"(()(()))"` are all valid parentheses strings.

A valid parentheses string `S` is **primitive** if it is nonempty, and there does not exist a way to split it into `S = A+B`, with `A` and `B` nonempty valid parentheses strings.

Given a valid parentheses string `S`, consider its primitive decomposition: `S = P_1 + P_2 + ... + P_k`, where `P_i` are primitive valid parentheses strings.

Return `S` after removing the outermost parentheses of every primitive string in the primitive decomposition of `S`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "(()())(())"
Output: "()()()"
Explanation: 
The input string is "(()())(())", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" = "()()()".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "(()())(())(()(()))"
Output: "()()()()(())"
Explanation: 
The input string is "(()())(())(()(()))", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())" + "(()(()))".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" + "()(())" = "()()()()(())".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "()()"
Output: ""
Explanation: 
The input string is "()()", with primitive decomposition "()" + "()".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "" + "" = "".
```

 

**Note:**

1. `S.length <= 10000`
2. `S[i]` is `"("` or `")"`
3. `S` is a valid parentheses string

## Analysis

In order to identify which parenthesis to be included inside our return string, we need to check two cases:

1. If current **open parenthesis** is the first parenthesis in the block of the decomposition, we should not add it. This means the current **unmatched pairs** in block is 1.
2. If current **close parenthesis** is the last parenthesis in the block of the decomposition, we should not add it. This means the current **unmatched pairs** in block is 0.

Let's walk through an example:

The left most column represent the current processing parthesis

```
For "(()(()))":
(    (|()(())): we have 1 unmatched pair -> "" don't do anything here
(    ((|)(())): we have 2 unmatched pair -> "("
)    (()|(())): we have 1 unmatched pair -> "()"
(    (()(|())): we have 2 unmatched pair -> "()("
(    (()((|))): we have 3 unmatched pair -> "()(("
)    (()(()|)): we have 2 unmatched pair -> "()(()"
)    (()(())|): we have 1 unmatched pair -> "()(())"
)    (()(()))|: we have 0 unmatched pair -> "()(())" don't do anything here
```

From this example, we can see that all we need is to count the number of unmatched pairs as well as the current processing parenthesis.

Time: $O(n)$

Space: $O(1)$

## Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string removeOuterParentheses(string S) {
        string res;
        int cnt = 0;
        for (char& c : S) {
            if (c == '(' && ++cnt != 1)
                res += c;
            if (c == ')' && --cnt != 0)
                res += c;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
