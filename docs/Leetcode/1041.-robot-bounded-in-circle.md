# 1041. Robot Bounded in Circle

On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at `(0, 0)` and faces north. The robot can receive one of three instructions:

- `"G"`: go straight 1 unit;
- `"L"`: turn 90 degrees to the left;
- `"R"`: turn 90 degrees to the right.

The robot performs the `instructions` given in order, and repeats them forever.

Return `true` if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: instructions = "GGLLGG"
Output: true
Explanation: The robot moves from (0,0) to (0,2), turns 180 degrees, and then returns to (0,0).
When repeating these instructions, the robot remains in the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: instructions = "GG"
Output: false
Explanation: The robot moves north indefinitely.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: instructions = "GL"
Output: true
Explanation: The robot moves from (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) -> (-1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> ...
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= instructions.length <= 100`
- `instructions[i]` is `'G'`, `'L'` or, `'R'`.

## Analysis

1. if after mimicing the instructions ends up with x = 0, y = 0, that means it's already a circle, so we return true.
2. if after mimicing we ends up with a direction other than going up (if it's up, then that is the only direcion and we cannot go back), we can still make it a circle

## Code

```c
class Solution {
public:
    bool isRobotBounded(string instructions) {
        int sx = 0, sy = 0;
        int dir = 0; // 0: up, 1: left, 2: down, 3: right
        for (char c : instructions) {
            if (c == 'G') {
                if (dir == 0) sx ++;
                else if (dir == 1) sy --;
                else if (dir == 3) sy ++;
                else sx --;
            } else if (c == 'L')  dir = (dir + 1) % 4;
            else dir = (dir + 3) % 4;
        }
        return sx == 0 && sy == 0 || dir > 0;
    }
};
```
