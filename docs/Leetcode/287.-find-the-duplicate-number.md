Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
Note:

You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

## Analysis

We can think about this problem similer to [linkedlist cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/). For each element in the array:
**i has an edge to nums[i]**. If we find a cycle, that means there are two index pointing to one same element from the array.

For example, nums = [1,3,4,2,2], using graph it will represent:

There is one and only one node with in degree of two, which makes the "linkedlist" a cycle, and our task is to find the one with in degree of two.

1. using two pointers to get into the cycle: one pointer move by one step each time, the other move by two steps.
2. reset one of the pointers to 0, so that it's outside the cycle, keep going the other one and the current one until they meet. The only node that these two pointers will meet is the one with in-degree of 2.

* Time: $O(2 \times n)$
* Space: $O(1)$

## Code

```c
class Solution {
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        int a = 0, b = 0;
        do { // do while since 0 == 0 is our initial condition
            a = nums[nums[a]];
            b = nums[b];
        }  while (a != b) ;
        a = 0;
        while (a != b) {
            a = nums[a];
            b = nums[b];
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```
