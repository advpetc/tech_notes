Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

# Using two pointers

if height[r] > height[l], then the next bigger one will be somewhere betweeen height[l+1] - height[r]

curr = (height[r] - height[l]) * (r - l)

next two candidates are:
1. (height[r-1] - height[l]) * (r - 1 - l) = 
   (height[r-1] - height[l]) * (r - l) - (height[r-1] - height[l]) * 1
2. (height[r] - height[l+1]) * (r - 1 - l) =
   (height[r] - height[l+1]) * (r - l) - (height[r] - height[l+1]) * 1

Use 1. - curr:
