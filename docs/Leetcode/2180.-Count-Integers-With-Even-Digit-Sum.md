# 2180. Count Integers With Even Digit Sum
Given a positive integer `num`, return _the number of positive integers **less than or equal to**_ `num` _whose digit sums are **even**_.

The **digit sum** of a positive integer is the sum of all its digits.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
The only integers less than or equal to 4 whose digit sums are even are 2 and 4.    

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = 30
Output: 14
Explanation:
The 14 integers less than or equal to 30 whose digit sums are even are
2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28.

```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= num <= 1000`

## Analysis

We can use the bitwise operation to save some space for a big integer's sum (although a big integer's digit sum is always less than the big integer itself). We know 
1. even + even = even
2. odd + odd = even
3. even + odd = odd

Using this property, we don't really need to calculate the sum, but just to check each digit's parity.

* Time: $O(n \times d)$ each number runs digits times for checking the sum 
* Space: $O(1)$

## Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int countEven(int num) {
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= num; ++i) {
            bool even = true;
            int a = i;
            while (a) {
                even = (even != (a & 1));
                a /= 10;
            }
            if (even) cnt ++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
