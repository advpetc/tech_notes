# 0069. Sqrt(t)

Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of *x*, where *x* is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

## Analysis

1. we could "try" all the values from 0 to x, and find the largest value y where y * y is less than x. y is our answer â€” we can use binary search for this problem. Don't forget to subtract 1 after calculation, since the question wants to discard all the digits after the decimal (1.2->1).

2. Newton Iteration: to find $x^2=n$, we can first rearrange our function into $f(x)=n-x^2$, and we want to find the solution when $f(x)=0$. The key point is the average result is calculate by "ans = (ans + x / ans) / 2";

   For instance, when calculating sqrt(2) :

   ```
      Guess Result        Quotient                             Average Result
             1          	2 / 1 = 2                            (2 + 1) / 2 = 1.5
            1.5      	2 / 1.5 = 1.3333                (1.3333 + 1.5) / 2 = 1.4167
          1.4167    	2 / 1.4167 = 1.4118          (1.4167 + 1.4118) / 2 = 1.4142
           ... ...
   ```

## Code 1

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x <= 1) return x;
        // left is our candidate, right is our target
      	int left = 0, right = x;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (x / mid >= mid) left = mid + 1;
            else right = mid;
        }
        return right - 1;
    }
};
```

## Code 2

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        double res = 1, pre = 0;
        while (abs(res - pre) > 1e-6) {
            pre = res;
            res = (res + x / res) / 2;
        }
        return int(res);
    }
};
```
