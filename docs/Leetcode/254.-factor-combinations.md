# Factor Combinations

Numbers can be regarded as product of its factors. For example,

```
8 = 2 x 2 x 2;
  = 2 x 4.
```

Write a function that takes an integer *n* and return all possible combinations of its factors.

**Note:**

1. You may assume that *n* is always positive.
2. Factors should be greater than 1 and less than *n*.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: 1
Output: []
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: 37
Output:[]
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: 12
Output:
[
  [2, 6],
  [2, 2, 3],
  [3, 4]
]
```

**Example 4:** 

```
Input: 32
Output:
[
  [2, 16],
  [2, 2, 8],
  [2, 2, 2, 4],
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
  [2, 4, 4],
  [4, 8]
]
```

## Analysis

In order to generate all the valid factors, we need to make sure `target % factor == 0`. However, there is a problem: how to deal with duplication:

We use a variable `index` to track the current factor, and if we choose current factor, we should **not** update `index`, because we can potentially reuse the same factor for multiple times.

Note: since all the factors cannot be greater than sqrt(num), in the inner loop, we just need to loop from `index` to sqrt(n)

## Code

```c
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> getFactors(int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        helper(n, 2, {}, res);
        return res;
    }
    void helper(int n, int start, vector<int> out, vector<vector<int>>& res) {
        if (n == 1) {
            if (out.size() > 1) res.push_back(out);
            return;
        }
        for (int i = start; i <= sqrt(n); ++i) {
            if (n % i != 0) continue;
            out.push_back(i);
            helper(n / i, i, out, res);
            out.pop_back();
        }
    }
};
```
