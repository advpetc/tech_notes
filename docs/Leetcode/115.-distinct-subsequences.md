# Distinct Subsequences

Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

It's guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

rabbbit
^^^^ ^^
rabbbit
^^ ^^^^
rabbbit
^^^ ^^^
Example 2:

Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

babgbag
^^ ^
babgbag
^^    ^
babgbag
^    ^^
babgbag
  ^  ^^
babgbag
    ^^^

## Analysis

S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
rabbbit
^^^^ ^^
rabbbit
^^ ^^^^
rabbbit
^^^ ^^^

**note: can only delete**

dp[i][j]: ways to transform S[0:i] to T[0:j]

1. if t is "", then only one way to form t from s (delete all)
2. if t[i] == s[j]: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]+dp[i][j-1] -> t can choose either delete the current one or not, both are valid
3. if t[i] != s[j]: dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] -> the extra one cannot be counted and should only use the previous stage result (delete current one)

## Code

```c
class Solution {
public:
    int numDistinct(string s, string t) {
        int m = t.length(), n = s.length();
        int64_t dp[m+1][n+1];
        memset(dp, 0, sizeof dp);
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) dp[0][j] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++)
            for (int j = i; j <= n; j++)
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + (t[i - 1] == s[j - 1] ? dp[i - 1][j - 1] : 0);
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}; 
```
