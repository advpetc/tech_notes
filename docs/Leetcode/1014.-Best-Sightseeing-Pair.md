# Best Sightseeing Pair

Given an array `A` of positive integers, `A[i]` represents the value of the `i`-th sightseeing spot, and two sightseeing spots `i` and `j` have distance `j - i` between them.

The *score* of a pair (`i < j`) of sightseeing spots is (`A[i] + A[j] + i - j)` : the sum of the values of the sightseeing spots, **minus** the distance between them.

Return the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [8,1,5,2,6]
Output: 11
Explanation: i = 0, j = 2, A[i] + A[j] + i - j = 8 + 5 + 0 - 2 = 11
```

 

**Note:**

1. `2 <= A.length <= 50000`
2. `1 <= A[i] <= 1000`

## Analysis

By using brute-force, it will cause TLE.

We can rarrange the equation into `A[i] + i + A[j] - j`, where i < j. So that we just need to make sure `A[i] + i` is the maximum and since it's always on the left side of j and A[j], we can "lazy" update its value when we process to the right.



Time: $O(n)$

Space: $O(1)$

## Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxScoreSightseeingPair(vector<int>& A) {
        int res = 0, n = A.size(), mx = 0; // mx = A[i] + i
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            res = max(res, mx + A[i] - i);
            mx = max(mx, A[i] + i);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
