## The Number of Weak Characters in the Game

You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has **two** main properties: **attack** and **defense**. You are given a 2D integer array `properties` where `properties[i] = [attacki, defensei]` represents the properties of the `ith` character in the game.

A character is said to be **weak** if any other character has **both** attack and defense levels **strictly greater** than this character's attack and defense levels. More formally, a character `i` is said to be **weak** if there exists another character `j` where `attackj > attacki` and `defensej > defensei`.

Return *the number of **weak** characters*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: properties = [[5,5],[6,3],[3,6]]
Output: 0
Explanation: No character has strictly greater attack and defense than the other.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: properties = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The first character is weak because the second character has a strictly greater attack and defense.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: properties = [[1,5],[10,4],[4,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The third character is weak because the second character has a strictly greater attack and defense.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= properties.length <= 10^5`
- `properties[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= attacki, defensei <= 10^5`

### Analysis

Notice the data range is $10^5$, in this case we should think about an algorithm that is with complexity of $O(n \times \log(n))$.

If we sort the array by attack in decreasing order, we can focus on the defence of any adjactant twos, because we can be sure that for any `i < j`, `p[i][0] > p[j][0]` and if `p[i][0] == p[j][0]` then `p[i][1] < p[j][1]`

However, there is a case when: `i < j < k` and `p[i][1] > p[j][1] > or = p[k][1] `, and this will contribute another pair due to `p[i][1] > p[k][1]`. This will only happen when we see a new largest `p[i][1]`, and it will only contribute one more pair. So we need to keep track of the largest defence in each round.

* Time: $O(n \times \log(n) + n)$ due to sorting
* Space: $O(1)$ quick sort without using the aux array will help to achieve it

### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfWeakCharacters(self, p: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ## any i < j, p[i][0] > p[j][0] and if p[i][0] == p[j][0] then p[i][1] < p[j][1]       
        p.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0],x[1])) 
         
        ans = 0
        curr_max = 0
        
        for _, d in p:
            if d < curr_max:
                ans += 1
            else:
                curr_max = d
        return ans        
        
#         a < b < c < d
#         a < b, b < c, a < c, c < d, b < d, a < d (1+4)*4/2
```
