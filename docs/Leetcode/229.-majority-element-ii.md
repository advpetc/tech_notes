# Majority Element II

Given an integer array of size `n`, find all elements that appear more than `⌊ n/3 ⌋` times.

**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: [1]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

## Anaysis

This problem is an extension to the Majority Element.

1. there are no elements that appear more than n/3 times, then whatever the algorithm got from 1st round would be rejected in the second round.
2. there is only one element that appears more than n/3 times, after 1st round one of the candidates must be that appears more than n/3 times(<2n/3 other elements could only pair out for <n/3 times), the other candidate is not necessarily the second most frequent but it would be rejected in 2nd round.
3. there are two elements that appear more than n/3 times, candidates would contain both of them. (<n/3 other elements couldn't pair out any of the majorities.)

## Code

```c
class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
            vector<int> res;
            int a = 0, b = 0, cnt1 = 0, cnt2 = 0, n = nums.size();
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (num == a) {
                    ++cnt1; 
                } else if (num == b) {
                    ++cnt2; 
                } else if (cnt1 == 0) {
                    a = num;
                    cnt1 = 1;
                } else if (cnt2 == 0) {
                    b = num;
                    cnt2 = 1;
                } else {
                    --cnt1;
                    --cnt2;
                }
            }
            cnt1 = cnt2 = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (num == a) {
                    ++cnt1; 
                } else if (num == b) {
                    ++cnt2; 
                }
            }

            if (cnt1 > n / 3) {
                res.push_back(a); 
            }

            if (cnt2 > n / 3) {
                res.push_back(b); 
            }

            return res;
        }
};
