Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

Note: The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
Example 2:

Input: [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]
Output: [1,2]

This problem is an extension to the Majority Element.

1. there are no elements that appears more than n/3 times, then whatever the algorithm  got from 1st round would be rejected in the second round.
2. there are only one elements that appears more than n/3 times, after 1st round one of  the candicate must be that appears more than n/3 times(<2n/3 other elements could only pair out for <n/3 times), the other candicate is not necessarily be the second most frequent but it would be rejected in 2nd round.
3. there are two elments appears more than n/3 times, candicates would contain both of them. (<n/3 other elements couldn't pair out any of the majorities.)

## Code

```c
class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
            vector<int> res;
            int a = 0, b = 0, cnt1 = 0, cnt2 = 0, n = nums.size();
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (num == a) {
                    ++cnt1; 
                } else if (num == b) {
                    ++cnt2; 
                } else if (cnt1 == 0) {
                    a = num;
                    cnt1 = 1;
                } else if (cnt2 == 0) {
                    b = num;
                    cnt2 = 1;
                } else {
                    --cnt1;
                    --cnt2;
                }
            }
            cnt1 = cnt2 = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (num == a) {
                    ++cnt1; 
                } else if (num == b) {
                    ++cnt2; 
                }
            }

            if (cnt1 > n / 3) {
                res.push_back(a); 
            }

            if (cnt2 > n / 3) {
                res.push_back(b); 
            }

            return res;
        }
};
