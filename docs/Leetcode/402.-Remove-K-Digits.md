# 402. Remove K Digits

Given string num representing a non-negative integer `num`, and an integer `k`, return *the smallest possible integer after removing* `k` *digits from* `num`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= num.length <= 105`
- `num` consists of only digits.
- `num` does not have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.

## Analysis

This question asks to remove arbitrary `k` digits from `num` to form the smallest string. We can drill down the problem from a simple question like how to remove one digit from the string.  For example, given `12321` we will remove `3` from the string because `1221` should be the smallest string. Given `123291` we should remove `3` instead of `9` because `12321` is bigger than `12291`. From here, we realize that we cannot just remove the largest element but we should check from left to right to minimize the preceding elements that are the smallest. In another word, we should maintain the smallest possible non-decreasing string, and it sounds like a monotonic stack algorithm. 

Since we are using a string, we can mimic the string as a stack: there is a `pop_back` in `string` we can use.

* Time: $O(n)$
* Space: $O(n)$ for the stack

## Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string removeKdigits(string a, int k) {
        string res;
        int n = a.size(), keep = n - k;
        for (char c : a) {
          	// note: this is a while loop to compare all the previous 
          	// smaller char,  because there could be multiple smaller char in front of i
            while (k && !res.empty() && res.back() > c) {
                res.pop_back();
                --k;
            }	
            res += c;
        }
        res.resize(keep); // keep the smallest first n - k chars
        // remove the leading zeros
        while (!res.empty() && res[0] == '0') {
            res.erase(res.begin());
        }
        return res.empty() ? "0" : res;
    }

};
```
