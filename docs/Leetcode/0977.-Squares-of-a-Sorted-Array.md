# 0977. Squares of a Sorted Array

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order, return *an array of **the squares of each number** sorted in non-decreasing order*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

 

**Follow up:** Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an `O(n)` solution using a different approach?

## Analysis

This question can be solved using two pointers method to achieve linear time complexity. Since the given array has negative values, there is a possible case when $nums[left] ^ 2$ is greater than $nums[right] ^ 2$. However, it is also true that from any points from left or from right, the square of each element is montonic increasing. The only exception to the previous statement is when `left == right`â€“ when the two pointers met, and we can use that as the termination condition.

* Time: $O(n)$
* Space: $O(n)$ for the solution array

## Code

```c++
#define abs(x) (x > 0 ? x : -x)
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortedSquares(vector<int>& nums) {
        int sz = nums.size();
        vector<int> res(sz);
        for (int l = 0, r = sz - 1, p = sz - 1; l <= r; --p) {
            res[p] = (max(nums[l] * nums[l], nums[r] * nums[r]));
          	// choose the next greatest one by eliminating the current largest one
            if (abs(nums[l]) > abs(nums[r])) l ++; 
            else r --;
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```
