# 636. Exclusive Time of Functions

On a **single-threaded** CPU, we execute a program containing `n` functions. Each function has a unique ID between `0` and `n-1`.

Function calls are **stored in a [call stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack)**: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is **the current function being executed**. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.

You are given a list `logs`, where `logs[i]` represents the `ith` log message formatted as a string `"{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}"`. For example, `"0:start:3"` means a function call with function ID `0` **started at the beginning** of timestamp `3`, and `"1:end:2"` means a function call with function ID `1` **ended at the end** of timestamp `2`. Note that a function can be called **multiple times, possibly recursively**.

A function's **exclusive time** is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for `2`time units and another call executing for `1` time unit, the **exclusive time** is `2 + 1 = 3`.

Return *the **exclusive time** of each function in an array, where the value at the* `ith` *index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID* `i`.

 **Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, logs = ["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","0:start:6","0:end:6","0:end:7"]
Output: [8]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.
Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","1:start:6","1:end:6","0:end:7"]
Output: [7,1]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 units of time, and ends at the end of time 6.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","1:start:7","1:end:7","0:end:8"]
Output: [8,1]
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: n = 1, logs = ["0:start:0","0:end:0"]
Output: [1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= logs.length <= 500`
- `0 <= function_id < n`
- `0 <= timestamp <= 109`
- No two start events will happen at the same timestamp.
- No two end events will happen at the same timestamp.
- Each function has an `"end"` log for each `"start"` log.

## Analysis

By observation, we can find that two ids cannot interlace with each other (this is invalid: ["0:start:0","1:start:2","0:end:3","1:end:5"]), so we can maintain a stack that records the start time's id, so when finish we pop the top one (which is guarantee to be the last started id).

* if new one is another "start" timestamp, we push to the stack and update the top id's execuation time.
* if new one is another "end" timestamp, we pop the top one and update the resulting time.

Time: O(n) since each element is going to run into the stack once
Space: O(n)

## Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> inline parse(string& str) {
        string id, status, timestamp;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < str.length(); ++i) {
            if (str[i] == ':' && !j) {
                id = str.substr(0, i);
                j = i + 1;            
            } else if (str[i] == ':' && j) {
                status = str.substr(j, i - j);
                j = i + 1;
            } else if (i == str.length() - 1) {
                timestamp = str.substr(j);
            }
        }
        return {id, status, timestamp};
    }
    
    vector<int> exclusiveTime(int n, vector<string>& logs) {
        vector<int> time(n);
        auto first = parse(logs[0]);
        stack<int> st{{ stoi(first[0]) }};
        for (int i = 1, prev = stoi(first[2]); i < logs.size(); ++i) {
            auto raw = parse(logs[i]);
            if (raw[1] == "start") {
                if (!st.empty())
                    time[st.top()] += stoi(raw[2]) - prev;
                st.push(stoi(raw[0]));
                prev = stoi(raw[2]);
            } else {
                time[st.top()] += stoi(raw[2]) - prev + 1;
                st.pop();
                prev = stoi(raw[2]) + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return time;
    }
};
```
