# Number of Enclaves

Given a 2D array `A`, each cell is 0 (representing sea) or 1 (representing land)

A move consists of walking from one land square 4-directionally to another land square, or off the boundary of the grid.

Return the number of land squares in the grid for which we **cannot** walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
There are three 1s that are enclosed by 0s, and one 1 that isn't enclosed because its on the boundary.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
All 1s are either on the boundary or can reach the boundary.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 500`
2. `1 <= A[i].length <= 500`
3. `0 <= A[i][j] <= 1`
4. All rows have the same size.

## Analysis

What this question is asking: give a grid, count all the land that is disconnected to the border.

Step 1: find all the 1 from the borders.

Step 2: "flood fill" from border to all the internal land.

Step 3: recursively fill all the neighbours of current land.

Step 4: count the number of 1s in the grid.

Time: $O(m \times n)$

Space: $O(m \times n)$ possible stack space allocated for the dfs call

## Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int dir[4][2] = {{1,0},{-1,0},{0,1},{0,-1}};
    int m, n;
    
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& A, int x, int y) {    	
        if (x >= m || y >= n || x < 0 || y < 0 || A[x][y] == 0)
            return ;
        A[x][y] = 0;
        for (auto d : dir) {
            dfs(A, x + d[0], y + d[1]);
        }
    }
    int numEnclaves(vector<vector<int>>& A) {
        
        m = A.size(), n = A[0].size();
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
              	// here we do a trick: 1 * 0, 0 * 1 and 0 * 0 == 0
              	// equal to i == 0 || j == 0
                if (i * j == 0 || i == m - 1 || j == n - 1) 
                  dfs(A, i, j);
            }
        }
        
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                if (A[i][j] == 1) res ++;
        return res;
                
    }
};
```
